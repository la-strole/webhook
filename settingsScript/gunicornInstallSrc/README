Examine the configuration of the gunicorn.service. 
In this case, gunicorn is employed to manage the webhook for interacting with Docker. 
As a result, I establish a user named "webhook" and a group named "docker." 
It's possible that I might want to modify this setup in the future. 
However, if I decide to alter the user and group settings here, 
I would also need to adjust the permissions of the users who manipulate Docker.
